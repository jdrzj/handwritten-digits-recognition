# handwritten-digits-recognition
Handwritten digits recognition using NN and Ruby ðŸ§ ðŸ’Ž

## About the project
This project is using neural network written for handwritten digits recognition.
Model was trained and tested on [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) handwritten digits set converted into libsvm format dataset.
Set contains 60k train and 10k test examples.


## Instalation
Application is using [Rumale::Torch](https://github.com/yoshoku/rumale-torch), which requires to install [LibTorch](https://github.com/ankane/torch.rb#libtorch-installation):

```bash
brew install automake libtorch
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```
